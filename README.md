# Space Invaders
Recreating the classic space invaders game using the Pygame module in Python.

New to the python language and written purely as a learning exercise.

Due to the corona virus invading, Boris Johnson currently represents the spaceship, and corona represents the aliens.
Boris will randomly throw toilet paper, vaccine syringes, soapbars and pound coins in a bid to defeat this disease.
Keep up the good work Boris! Do us proud!
